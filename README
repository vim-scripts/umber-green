I just grabbed the colorscheme_template and tried to satisfy my nostalgia for old green and  umber-toned monochrome monitors with a nice contrast in both low-light and (less so) bright environments.  Just a few colours, highlighting only the most important stuff. Works nicely so far for editing .c files on with my CRT using a gvim. I'll have to work on it yet (i.e. making it work in a console), so if you have comments, wishes or recommendations...
